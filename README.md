# Shift Click: Template Project

Welcome! This is a 'bare-bones' HTML/CSS website to get you started on your final project for Shift Click. The aim here is to give you just enough structure to get going without puzzling about how to get the JS, CSS, and HTML all talking to each other properly.

## Getting started

### Step 1: Create your Github repo
You can get started by clicking on 'Use this template' above â€“ this creates a new repository in your own Github account. To host your website with Github Pages you'll need to name this new repository `username.github.io`, replacing `username` with your own Github username.

### Step 2: Open in VS Code
Now that you have a new repo in Github, the next step is to bring this into VS Code so you can work on it locally.

Open a new VS Code Window, by going to `File > New Window` then select the Source Control panel from the menu on the left-hand side. Click on the `Clone Repository` button, copy-paste the URL of your Github repo and hit return, then choose somewhere on your computer to copy the files to. You're off!

### Step 3: Open in your browser
You can preview your website from your favourite web browser as you're working on it in VS Code. Select `File > Open File` from the top menu in your web browser, then open `index.html`. As you make changes to your code, you can use the 'reload' button on the browser's top menu (next to the forward and back buttons) to see your changes.

## Uploading your website to Github Pages
Once you're ready to move everything up to the web, you have two options. Choose whichever feels the most comfortable!

### The 'proper' way
You can use Github and VS Code together, keeping track of your project as it develops in the same way that you did in the Github 'Hello World' guide: creating branches, making changes and committing them, then pushing your commits from your local computer up to Github (which automatically updates your Pages website.) For more details on how to do this, check out this video: [Version Control in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/versioncontrol).

### Another (easier but hackier) way
It's an established fact that Git and Github can cause headaches for even the most veteran software developer. If you don't feel ready to go deeper into using Git right now, and instead just want to get your website up so you can share it with us then go ahead and do things this way. No judgement ;-)

Navigate to your repository URL on Github, select `Add File > Upload Files` then create a commit by uploading the contents of your local folder. Just make sure that you preserve the folder structure though, otherwise you'll end up with broken links everywhere.
